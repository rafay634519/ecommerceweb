## Spring Boot E-Commerce Project

This completed project built an e-commerce website with Java, Spring Boot, and other technologies.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main applications: the Admin application and the Shopping application.

### Admin Application

The Admin application provides administrative functionalities for managing the e-commerce website. The following features are available in the Admin application:

- Users: Manage user accounts and permissions. The admin can create, update, and delete user accounts. User roles and permissions can be assigned to control access to various features.
- Categories: Manage product categories. Admin can create, update, and delete categories, and assign products to specific categories.
- Brands: Manage brands for the products. Admin can create, update, and delete brands and associate them with products.
- Products: Manage the products available for sale. Admin can add new products, update existing products, and remove products from the inventory. Each product has details such as name, description, price, image, and stock availability.
- Customers: Manage customer information. Admin can view and update customer details such as name, address, and contact information.
- Shipping: Manage shipping options and information. Admin can configure different shipping methods, rates, and delivery timeframes.
- Orders: View and manage customer orders. Admin can view and update order statuses, track shipments, and handle customer inquiries related to orders.

### Shopping Application

The Shopping application is the front-end of the e-commerce website where customers can browse and purchase products. The following features are available in the Shopping application:

- Categories Listing: Customers can browse products by categories. They can select a specific category and view all products associated with that category.
- Product Details: Customers can view detailed information about a specific product, including its name, description, price, images, and customer reviews.
- Search Products: Customers can search for products based on keywords. The search functionality allows customers to find products quickly and easily.
- Shopping Cart: Customers can add products to the cart for purchase. They can add multiple products, update quantities, and remove items from the cart.
- Checkout: Customers can proceed to the checkout process. They can enter their shipping and billing information, select a shipping method, and review the order before making a payment.
- Manage Orders: Customers can view and manage their orders. They can track the status of their orders, view order history, and request order cancellations or returns.
- Tracking Orders: Customers can track the status of their orders. They can check the current location and estimated delivery date of their shipments.
- Customer Registration: New customers can register on the website. They can create an account, provide their personal information, and set up a password for future logins.

## Additional Technologies

In addition to the main features and functions, I also want to implement the following technologies in the project, but it is not certain yet.

- Spring Data JPA and Hibernate: Persistence and database management. These technologies provide seamless integration with the database, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- Spring Security: Authentication and authorization. The project uses Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain features and resources.
- Spring Mail: Sending customer registration confirmation and order confirmation emails. Customers receive confirmation emails after registering on the website and placing orders.
- JUnit, AssertJ, and Mockito: Unit testing. The project includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionalities.
- Spring RESTful Web services: Building RESTful APIs. The project provides RESTful APIs for various functionalities, allowing integration with other systems or external applications.
- Bootstrap 4, HTML5, and jQuery 3: Front-end development. The project utilizes Bootstrap, HTML5, and jQuery to create a responsive and user-friendly interface for the e-commerce website.
